# utility-header-to-python-blockly

Python/Jupyter helper to interpret C/C++ headers to Python comprehensible arrays, and tool to generate Blockly JS custom blocks.

This is part of Gen7 Engine's used and developed utilities open sourceing process for the greater good.
It's used in part to automatically generate a Blockly visual programming toolkit only with their corresponding headers and streamline releases.
